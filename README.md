# CS4555

This project is based on the ideas of Daniel O., Sergio M., and Michael S. It is a game idea of what would happen if a Spaniard Colonist was left in Ancient America (with natives), and his exploration in the horrors of the tribes. 

This is meant to be a Hack-and-Slash, Multi-Ending, Horror game.
